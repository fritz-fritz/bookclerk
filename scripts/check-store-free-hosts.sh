# Some regions restrict distributing a binary that can circumvent DRM, so a
# packager must be able to build `bookclerk` / `bookclerkd` without linking a
# store. That only holds while nothing in the host graph reaches a cipher by
# another route: a shared crate that grew an `aes` dependency, or a plugin
# promoted from optional to required, would take the option away without
# breaking any test. Hence this check.
