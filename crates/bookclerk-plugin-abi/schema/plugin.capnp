# Bookclerk plugin ABI — object-capability Workers RPC (`api_version = 3`).
#
# This file is the first supported plugin contract. Discarded development
# compatibility fields were removed and ordinals compacted. From this contract
# forward:
# - `apiVersion` / `plugin.toml` `api_version` is the single incompatible ABI
#   version. Manifest `api_version` and `describe().apiVersion` must match.
# - Named `rpcFeatures` negotiate optional facilities. Required features are
#   rejected at spawn when missing.
# - Do not reuse field, method, or union ordinals.
# - Unknown enum/union members: preserve the wire code and fail closed or
#   return typed `unsupported`. Never collapse unknown codes to `internal`.
# - Every variable-length field is bounded by the constants below.
# - Identifiers are non-empty `[a-z][a-z0-9_]{0,63}`. Timestamps are UTC
#   unix milliseconds (UInt64); zero means omitted.
# - Absent factories/methods return typed `unsupported`.
# - `describe()` advertises typed `PluginCapabilities` (exported entrypoints,
#   triggers, bindings). The signed manifest plus the operator grant is the
#   host allowlist; a guest that widens beyond either is refused.
#
# Authors never see transport-private capability table indexes. Public types
# are the interfaces below plus TypeScript `BookclerkPlugin`. ByteSource is
# the Cap'n Proto realization of a transferred byte ReadableStream.
#
# Method results are typed success/error unions. SDKs map `err` onto a thrown
# PluginError. Unknown future `code` strings MUST be preserved.
