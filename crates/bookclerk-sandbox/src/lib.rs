//! Portable, unprivileged process confinement.
//!
//! Bookclerk confines code by what it may touch, not by which uid it runs as.
//! Every backend here works without root, without setuid helpers, and without
//! user namespaces or bind mounts:
//!
//! - **Linux** — Landlock filesystem allowlist plus a seccomp-bpf deny list.
//! - **macOS** — Seatbelt (`sandbox_init`) with a deny-default SBPL profile.
//! - **Windows** — AppContainer applied at `CreateProcess`; see
//!   [`spawn`](crate::spawn). A process cannot confine *itself* on Windows, so
//!   [`Policy::confine_current_process`] reports the filesystem layer as
//!   [`LayerStatus::Unsupported`] there.
//!
//! Callers pick the failure mode with [`Enforcement`]. `Required` turns a
//! backend that cannot enforce into an error, which is what production paths
//! use so a missing jail can never pass silently.
