//! Windows backend.
//!
//! Windows has no self-confinement primitive: a process cannot drop itself into
//! an AppContainer after it has started. Isolation is granted at process
//! creation, by giving the child a token with an AppContainer SID and ACLing the
//! paths it may reach.
//!
//! So [`confine_current_process`] reports the filesystem layer as
//! [`LayerStatus::Unsupported`] here, which under [`crate::Enforcement::Required`]
//! is an error — callers on Windows must confine children at spawn instead.
//! The spawn-side implementation lands with the plugin and media-worker jails.
