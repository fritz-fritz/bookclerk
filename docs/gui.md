# GUI (web + tray companion)

Bookclerk ships a shared React UI for Discover, Wishlist, library, and account
linking, served by `bookclerkd`. The UI talks to the Rust HTTP API only
(TypeScript never hosts the API).

An optional **tray companion** (`bookclerk-tray`) spawns/attaches `bookclerkd`
and opens the UI in the system browser:

| OS | Backend |
| --- | --- |
| Linux | StatusNotifierItem (`ksni`, no GTK/WebKit) |
| Windows / macOS | `tray-icon` with default features **disabled** (no GTK) |

An embedded Tauri window remains deferred pending an OSV-clean GTK4 graph —
tracked in [#44](https://github.com/fritz-fritz/bookclerk/pull/44). Path notes:
[gui-desktop-path.md](gui-desktop-path.md).

## Auth (operator + portal)

The SPA supports two session types:

| Role | How to sign in | Capabilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Operator** | Paste `operator.token` | Full library, scan/acquire, jobs, Discover, Wishlist, Accounts |
| **Portal** | Claim ticket or integration return-visit login | Discover (personalized), Wishlist, library of **linked-account books only** (no acquire), Accounts |

| Item | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Operator token | `$BOOKCLERK_FILES_DIR/operator.token` / `BOOKCLERK_OPERATOR_TOKEN` |
| Operator cookie | `bookclerk_operator_session` (`Path=/`) |
| Portal cookie | `bookclerk_portal_session` (`Path=/`) — also used by legacy `/connect` |
| Portal APIs | `/api/portal/*` (SPA Accounts); legacy HTML still at `/connect` |
| Config | `[daemon.auth]` |
| User prefs (DB) | `GET` / `PATCH /api/preferences` — `default_view`, `disabled_shelves` |

`GET /api/auth/me` returns `{ authenticated, role, default_view, can_acquire, portal? }`
with `default_view` from the caller's SQLite preferences row.

## Default view

After auth the SPA opens the signed-in user's **`default_view`** (default
**`discover`**). Change it in Discover → settings, or:

```http
PATCH /api/preferences
Content-Type: application/json

{ "default_view": "library" }
```

Values: `discover` | `wishlist` | `library` | `accounts`. Stored in
`user_preferences` (subject `operator` or `portal:{identity_id}`), not
`config.toml`.

## Screens

- **Discover** — Netflix-style shelves with horizontal infinite scroll; top
  multi-store catalog search with autocomplete (wishlist from suggestions or
  cards); no manual request form
- **Wishlist** — personal open wishes plus a sidebar **global queue** ranked by
  Discover taste signals with a heavy boost for multi-user wish counts
  (store-agnostic)
- **Library** — vertical infinite scroll; operators see acquire/scan; portal
  users see only books from accounts they linked
- **Accounts** — former Connect portal: link bookstore sources, revoke
  connections (claim ticket / credential login on the sign-in screen)

## Run

```bash
cd ui && npm ci && npm run build
export BOOKCLERK_FILES_DIR=/tmp/BookclerkFiles
cargo run -p bookclerkd
# open http://127.0.0.1:8787/
```

Dev (Vite with API proxy):

```bash
# terminal 1
BOOKCLERK_FILES_DIR=/tmp/BookclerkFiles cargo run -p bookclerkd
# terminal 2
cd ui && npm run dev   # http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

Override the static dist directory with `BOOKCLERK_UI_DIST`.

## Tray companion (`bookclerk-tray`)

```bash
cd ui && npm ci && npm run build
cargo build -p bookclerkd -p bookclerk-tray
BOOKCLERK_FILES_DIR=/tmp/BookclerkFiles cargo run -p bookclerk-tray
```

Menu: Open Bookclerk · Scan library · Print operator token · Quit. Left-click
opens the browser. Workspace member, not a `default-member`.

`tray-icon` is depended on only for Windows/macOS **and** with
`default-features = false`, so the root `Cargo.lock` does not resolve the Linux
GTK3 graph. Do not enable `tray-icon`/`muda` default features in this workspace.

## Brand assets

Production logo/mark/favicons live under [`assets/brand/`](../assets/brand/).
The UI copies web assets into `ui/public/`.
