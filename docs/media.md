# Media worker pool

Every decode, encode, and packaging step runs in a short-lived
`bookclerk-media-worker` process that confines itself to the paths its job
declared. This page covers why, what the boundary actually is, how to configure
it, and what to check when media work starts failing.

## Why codecs get their own process

Acquire feeds attacker-influenced audio through three C libraries: LAME
(`mp3lame-sys`), FDK-AAC (`fdk-aac-sys`), and Symphonia's native
dependencies. Before the pool, those parsers ran on tokio's blocking thread
pool — inside the process that holds the master data encryption key and an open
handle to `library.db`. A parser bug there is a key disclosure, not a failed
book.

Three properties follow from moving that work out:

- **The codecs cannot reach key material.** The jail allows the job's declared
  inputs and one output directory. `master.key`, `library.db`, and the rest of
  `$HOME` are not in the allowlist.
- **A crash costs one book.** The worker is a separate process, so a segfault
  in a decoder surfaces as a failed job. The bug fixed in `mp3.rs` (LAME
  writing past its output buffer) would previously have taken the daemon down
  with it.
- **Concurrency is a number you chose.** `media.workers` bounds how many codec
  jobs run at once, instead of however many threads tokio's blocking pool
  happened to grow under load.

## The boundary

One job is one process. Workers are deliberately not reused: filesystem
confinement is irreversible and process-wide, so a long-lived worker would need
a jail wide enough for every job it might later be handed. Media operations run
for seconds to minutes, which makes a few milliseconds of process spawn
irrelevant next to a tight per-job allowlist.

The host writes a JSON `MediaJob` to the worker's stdin and closes it. The
worker builds its policy from the job, confines itself, runs the codec, and
writes a JSON reply to stdout. Nothing configures the jail separately from the
request, so a job can never be granted more than it declared.

| Platform | Backend | Filesystem | Syscalls | Network |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | Landlock + seccomp-bpf | allowlist, ABI-probed | deny list | no IP sockets |
| macOS | Seatbelt (`sandbox_init`) | deny-default SBPL profile | — | denied in profile |
| Windows | AppContainer | spawn-time only | — | — |

macOS has no seccomp equivalent — Seatbelt gates operation classes rather than
syscall numbers — so the syscall layer reports as not applicable rather than as
a gap. The `(deny default)` profile already refuses `exec` and unlisted
operations, so nothing is lost.

**Windows cannot self-confine.** A process cannot drop itself into an
AppContainer after it has started; isolation is granted at `CreateProcess`,
which is not implemented yet. The pool detects this when it starts and refuses
media work under the default `isolation = "required"`, naming the reason in the
startup log. Windows users who want to acquire today must opt down explicitly:

```toml
[media]
isolation = "best-effort"  # codecs run unconfined on Windows
```

This is deliberately a decision the operator makes rather than a silent
fallback. It becomes unnecessary once the spawn-side AppContainer path lands.

What a job declares:

| Job | Reads | Writes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `encode_mp3` | input file | output's parent directory |
| `remux_trimmed` | input file | output's parent directory |
| `fixup` | input file, cover art | output's parent directory |
| `package_m4b` | every part | output's parent directory |
| `align_chapters` | input file | nothing |

Write grants are directories rather than single files because the codecs stage
output through temporary files beside the destination.

Symbolic links are granted at their **resolved target** — that is the inode the
kernel checks. Declaring a link therefore grants whatever it points at. Every
path in a job is built by the host from its own cache and output roots, so
nothing untrusted picks them, but a destination plugin that resolves output
paths from user input should canonicalize first.

## Configuration

```toml
[media]
workers = 0             # 0 derives one per core, capped at 8
isolation = "required"  # required | best-effort | off
# worker_bin = "/usr/local/bin/bookclerk-media-worker"
```

Environment overrides win over TOML, as everywhere else:
`BOOKCLERK_MEDIA_WORKERS`, `BOOKCLERK_MEDIA_ISOLATION`,
`BOOKCLERK_MEDIA_WORKER`.

`isolation` picks what happens when a confinement layer does not engage:

- **`required`** (default) — refuse the job. A host that cannot sandbox should
  not decode untrusted audio in the same process as the master key.
- **`best-effort`** — apply what the platform supports and log the rest. For
  kernels without Landlock, accepting that codecs run unconfined there.
- **`off`** — run codec work in-process on a blocking thread, no jail, no child
  process. Development only.

`best-effort` covers layers the *platform* cannot enforce. It does not cover a
worker binary that was never installed: that is a packaging error, and both
modes refuse jobs rather than silently fall back to in-process execution. Set
`isolation = "off"` if unconfined codecs are genuinely what you want.

The pool decides at startup, not at first acquire, so a host that cannot honour
its configured mode says so in the startup log rather than failing every book
later.

## Installing the worker

The pool looks for the worker in this order:

1. `media.worker_bin` in `config.toml`
2. `BOOKCLERK_MEDIA_WORKER`
3. `bookclerk-media-worker` beside the running executable

Each candidate is checked for existence, so a stale configured path fails
loudly instead of degrading to an unconfined encode. Build and ship it with the
hosts:

```bash
cargo build --release -p bookclerk-cli -p bookclerkd -p bookclerk-media-worker
```

The Docker images copy it into `/usr/local/bin` alongside `bookclerk` and
`bookclerkd`.

## Troubleshooting

**`refusing to run <job> unconfined: media isolation is required but
unavailable`** — either the worker binary was not found (a configured path does
not exist, or nothing sits beside the host executable) or the platform has no
self-confinement primitive. The startup log line says which, naming the
directory searched or the backend that came up short. Install the worker beside
the host binary, point `media.worker_bin` at it, or drop to `best-effort` /
`off` if you accept unconfined codecs.

**`media worker (<job>) failed: worker exited with <status> before replying`** —
the worker died mid-job. Its stderr is inherited by the host, so the
confinement summary and any codec output land in the daemon log just above.

**Jobs fail with a missing input that is clearly on disk** — the path was not
in `read_paths()` for that job kind, so the jail denied it. Adding a new input
to a job means adding it there too; the worker validates declared inputs before
running the codec so this reports the path rather than a bare `No such file`
from inside a decoder.

**Everything is slow with plenty of idle cores** — `media.workers` is the cap.
Note that acquires themselves are still serialized daemon-wide by the job
lock; the pool bounds codec concurrency within an acquire, not across them.
